Say you're going to DEFCON 25, and you'd like to team with other cool women at defcon to compete in the CTFs and check out [@defconparties](https://twitter.com/defconparties).  This meetup was designed to bring together women ahead of the conference to maximize our time together inside the arena.

## About

Hacker Women run our DEFCON badge/registration mission like a pirate operation: Boots to ground at 5am; we join the hordes of zombies by 5:30am. Some of us drink coffee, others vodka. Whatever your taste, by 7am we're fully badged inside DEFCON, and we have a great time! After reg, over a solid breakfast, we'll meet and greet with the awesome women of DEFCON. We make new friends, figure out our conference plans together.  Most critical, this is an opportunity to join Hacker Women to propose teaming with our members for a contest you're coveting.  Last year the Hacker Women team competed in Mission SE Impossible pre-quals (reg at 10am) and Packet Hacking Village. In DC23 we focused our energies on lockpicking and hosting the "Secret Society of Women Lockpickers Speakeasy under DC Parties ~ what we do this year (and next year) is constantly evolving and growing.

#OpBadge is open to all women of DEFCON.  We invite women to bring their friends and family along ~ after all, we don't want to split ya away from your hacker fam to come see us!

2. Found him? Ok. Look to where he's pointing. Step back 5-10 paces, look up. See that sign with the arrow pointing you to Hotel Registration? Yes, that arrow, to the left. Now follow it. Hurry. And take this kitten.

Happy DEFCON 25! Please try to get some sleep after breakfast - 3 hours of sleep per 24 hours is the DEFCON rule :-)
